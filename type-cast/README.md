A cast is a special operator that forces one data type to be converted into another.
The most general cast supported by most of the C++ compilers is as follows:
```c++
(type) expression 
```

also there are useful functions such as `atol()`, `atoll()` and `atof()` to concert  C-type strings to `long integer`, `long long integer`, and `double`.
